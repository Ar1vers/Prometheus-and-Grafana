# Prometheus and Grafana Monitoring Service

## Project Overview
This project implements a monitoring solution for a Spring Boot application using Prometheus and Grafana. The service tracks application performance and provides real-time metrics using Micrometer. This system helps in monitoring critical business operations and understanding the application's health and performance.

## Key Features
- **Prometheus Integration**: The application uses Micrometer to collect metrics, which are then exposed to Prometheus for monitoring.
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Metrics collected by Prometheus are visualized using Grafana dashboards for better insights into system health.
- **Metrics Types**: Includes counters and timers for tracking the number of requests and their execution times.

## Project Structure
- **config/MonitoringConfig.java**
  - Contains the Spring configuration for Prometheus monitoring.
  - Defines beans for `CountedAspect` and `TimedAspect` to collect metrics such as request counts and execution times.
  - These metrics are sent to Prometheus for collection and can be visualized in Grafana.
- **pom.xml**
  - Maven configuration including dependencies for Prometheus integration (`micrometer-core`) and Spring Boot setup.
- **docker/**
  - Contains Docker configurations for running Prometheus, Grafana, and the application in a containerized environment.
- **src/**
  - Source code for the application, including controllers, services, and models.

## Accessing Grafana
- Once the containers are running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the Grafana dashboards.
- Default credentials for Grafana: `admin` / `admin`

## Monitoring Metrics
- Prometheus collects metrics from the Spring Boot application.
- Grafana visualizes the data for easy tracking and alerting.

## Sharding and Routing in the Application
The application scales horizontally by distributing data across multiple database shards. It uses dynamic routing to ensure that each userâ€™s data is efficiently stored and retrieved from the appropriate shard based on their user UUID.

## Advantages
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous performance tracking using Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Scalability**: Easily add new shards as the application grows.
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one shard do not affect others.
- **Comprehensive Visualizations**: Grafana dashboards provide in-depth insights into system health.
